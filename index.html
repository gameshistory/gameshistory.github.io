<b><i>Notes:</i></b>
<br><br>
In the 1970s, Atari outnumbered any other developer <b><i>four-to-one</i></b> in terms of unique game concepts.<br>
That said, it seems like the company ran into a bit of a creative block in 1977.<br>
Dominos (1977) and Destroyer (1977) were rip-offs of Gremlin's Blockade and Depthcharge.<br>
Likewise, Canyon Bomber (1977) was very similar to Meadow's Drop Zone 4.<br>
This leads to the question of whether Drag Race (1977) was a copy of Electra's Eliminator IV.<br>
Perhaps this is why Activision chose to rip-off Atari's Drag Race for their first game...
<br><br>

<b><i>Questions:</i></b>
<br><br>
Who made Safari? Taito or Gremlin?<br>
Which came first? Atari's Drag Race (1977) or Electra's Eliminator IV (1976)?<br>
Which came first? Flying Fortress [Electra] or Bomber [Sega]?<br>
Which came first? Robot Bowling [Exidy] or Meadows Lanes [Meadows]?<br>
Which came first? Space War [Leijac] or Space Beam [Irem]?<br>
When was Space Chaser and Sheriff released? 1979 or 1980?<br>
Did Seeburg's Deluxe Baseball really come out in 1974?<br>
<br>
Star Fire should be listed as a 1979 game. It inspired Asteroids' leaderboard and obviously came out before Star Fire II (1979).<br>
Space Invaders Galactica should say 1979 or 1980... That is, unless it really did come out before Galaxian (1979).<br>
Ski (1975) [Allied Leisure Industries] is not a video game... At least, according to an active owner on Arcade Museum.<br>
Why isn't Crossfire, Boxer, Castling, or Inferno in the Arcade Museum database?
